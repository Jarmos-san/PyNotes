# PyNotes

PyNotes is similar to my other side project [R_Notes](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/R_Notes). It's more of curated list of various resources(video tutorials, online courses, etc) and reading materials which I have made personally while referring to all the resources mentioned below.

- [Strings](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/PyNotes/blob/master/strings.md)
