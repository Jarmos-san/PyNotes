# PyNotes `WIP`

PyNotes is similar to my other side project [R_Notes](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/R_Notes). It's more of curated list of various resources(video tutorials, online courses, etc) and reading materials which I have made personally while referring to all the resources mentioned below.

This project is a **WORK-IN-PROGRESS** so feel free to add anything you prefer to be added here.

GOOD LUCK AND HAPPY LEARNING
