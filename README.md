Readers of PyNotes can expect a concise yet comprehensive book about the Python programming language. The inspiration to write such a book arose when I wanted to have a physical copy of a reference material for the language. Hence, through PyNotes I hope to achieve what I've been trying to do.

## Contributing To the Book

I'm a strong advocate of the open-source community, thus this version of the book hosted on GitHub will forever be **FREE** to download or read online to those interested. Besides, open-sourcing the contents of the book also enables me to make iterative updates to it as & when Python itself evolves as an Open-Source Software(OSS).

Accordingly, if you feel that your idea sharing knowledge aligns with mine, I will greatly appreciate your contribution to the cause. You can contribute to the project through various means. By simply sharing the project to someone who wants to learn Python can mean a lot for both the author & the reader.

Besides, if you're inclined to contribute to the project through other means, I suggest that you give the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/pynotes/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) a though read.
