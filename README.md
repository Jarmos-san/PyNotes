# PyNotes `WIP`

PyNotes is similar to my other side project [R_Notes](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/R_Notes). It's more of curated list of various resources(video tutorials, online courses, etc) and reading materials which I have made personally while referring to all the resources mentioned below.

- [Numbers and Variables](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/PyNotes/blob/master/numbers_%26_variables.md)
- [Strings](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/PyNotes/blob/master/strings.md)
- [String/Print Formatting Methods](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/PyNotes/blob/master/string_formatting.md)
- [Boolean & Comparison Operators](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/PyNotes/blob/master/boolean_comparison_operators.md)
