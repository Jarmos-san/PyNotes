'''
Stock Value. Compute value from number of shares×purchase price for a stock.
Once upon a time, stock prices were quoted in fractions of a dollar, instead 
of dollars and cents. Create a simple print statement for 125 shares purchased at
3.3/8. Create a second simple print statement for 150 shares purchased at 2.1/4
plus an additional 75 shares purchased at 1.7/8. Don’t manually convert 1/4 to 0.25. 
Use a complete expression of the form ‘2+1/4.0’, just to get more practice writing expressions.

#For 125 shares
print(125*(3+3/8))

#For 150 and 75 shares
print((150*(2+1/4)) + (75*1+7/8))
