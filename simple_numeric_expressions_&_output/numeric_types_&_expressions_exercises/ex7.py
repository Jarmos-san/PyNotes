Roulette Odds. How close are payouts and the odds?

An American(double zero) roulette wheel has numbers 1-36, 0 and 00. 18 out of the 36 numbers
are red, 18 are black and the zeroes are green. The odds of spinning red are then 18/38. The
odds of a zero or a double zero are then 2/36. 

Red pays 2 to 1, the real odds are 38/18.
