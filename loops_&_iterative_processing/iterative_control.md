# The `break` and `continue` Statement

Python offers certain loop control statements which can be replaced in place of using complicated and massively indented `if` statements for any common situtations.

The `break` Statement
---------
The `break` statement terminates a loop prematurely. It's always found within an `if` statement which is further indented inside a `for` or a `while` statement block. It's usually used when the terminating condition is too complex to write as an expression in the `while` statement clause. It can also be used in the `for` statement to abandon the execution even before the end of the sequence has been reached.

The `continue` Statement
------------
The `continue` statement is used to replace deeply nested `else` clauses. It's always found within an `if` statement, indented inside a `for` or a `while` loop.
