# A Brief Overview of Python

Python is a multi-paradigm general purpose scripting language. It's often used for writing small scripts to run without the need of compiling. Besides it's ease of use is what made Python so attractive to programmers from various backgrounds. Primarily, Python is used for the following reasons:

1. As stated in the _Zen of Python_, the focus of Python is to be easier to understand.

2. Python increases developer productivity by requiring them to write less code which will also run immediately without compiling.

3. There're over a million developers using Python at the time of writing this book. Thus apart from the very useful standard library Python also supports a wide range of third party libraries available via PyPi.

4. Python is also the world's second most popular language as of writing this book. It practically means, developers with Python skills has a higher chance of being hired.

## What Can You Do With Python

- Considering Python's simple syntax & decreased development, its often used for system programming. The built-in OS module abstracts a lot of low-level Operating System stuff with just a call of a simple function. Hence, Python is incredibly popular to work with in environments where manipulating the system is to be expected.

- Although Python isn't a very popular language to develop GUI applications with but due to frameworks like Tkinter & PyQT, it's popular among beginner Python enthusiasts/developers. If you're starting out programming for the first time ever, a GUI app with Tkinter should be a great starting point.

- Programming with Python isn't just limited to the simple scripting or GUI applications. It is also frequently used to power the backend systems of popular websites like Pinterest, Quora, etc. Web frameworks like Flask. Django are perhaps some of the most popular frameworks to develop web apps.

- Python can also be used a glue language in certain instances in embedded technology. C libraries can be enabled wherein it can be tested & launched onsite without the need for recompliling.

- Python also comes with in-built support for Database manipulation. The `SQLite` library comes packaged in the standard library & performs as a on-file SQL database engine which is perfect for quick prototyping & testing. Besides, on the non-SQL side, Python's standard `pickle` module provides a simple object persistence system, enabling entire Python objects to file & file-like objects. Hence, it's widely used in the field of Machine Learning(ML) for saving entire models onto a persistent file-system.

- If it's not obvious by now, but Python is perfect for rapid prototyping for later migrating into other lowel-level languages like C/C++. This ease of portability is more obvious in the field of ML where the models are expected to work in a low-level environment.

- Perhaps a major reason why Python is so popular because of the advancements made in the field of ML/AI. As of writing this book, it's literally considered the de facto go-to book if you want to dive into ML. Coupled with execellent  ML frameworks & libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch & Scikit-Learn, the ML community is yet to embrace some other language whole-heartedly.

- Python has almost completely replaced older popular languages which were used for numerical programming. Some of those older languages are FORTRAN/C++. Combined with NumPy which is a high-performance numeric programming extension for Python, the community has made very meaningful use of it in the field of ML & others.

- Generic Use Cases Like Data Mining & Such -- As mentioned earlier, Python is a general-purpose programming language & it's general-purposeness is more apparent through the fact that its used in varying other fields like data mining, robotics, gaming, natural language processing, etc.
