# A Brief Overview of Python

Python is a multi-paradigm general purpose scripting language which is used for writing small scripts to run without the need of compiling. Due it's ease of use, almost natural-language-like syntax, Python attracts programmers & beginners alike from various backgrounds from software developers to scientific experiments in CERN. But primarily, Python is used for the following reasons:

1. The [PEP 20 -- _Zen of Python_](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id2), states the focus of writing Python code should be for easier interpretability & less [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load). Accordingly, the Python syntax should be very familiar to individuals who has never written a line of code before, as it has a English natural-language-like syntax.

2. Python's simple synatx increases developer productivity by requiring them to write less code which also runs immediately without compiling. Thus, the language has become very popular among individuals in the field of Data Analytics or scientic programming where visualizations are important. Using Python these individuals can expect to see results of their work almost as immediately as the writing the code. In other words, Python is more of a "[_What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)" programming language in my opinion.

3. As of writing this book, Python is one of the most popular programming language out there among 57000+ respondents on Stack Overflow making it the [4th most popular language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)! What does it mean for you & me? Community support. Python already boasts a humongous [Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) & together with its extensive third party library support hosted at [PyPI -- The Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/), there's no reason why an interested individual should refrain from learning Python.

4. Being the most popular programming language also comes with certain advantages. The most obvious one is perhaps, availability of employment opportunities. Besides, most of the jobs available for a Python developer appears to be well paid too! As per Glassdoor reports, a Python Developer can expect a salary from anything between [$56K-$107K](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/python-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,16.htm?countryRedirect=true&countryRedirect=true). But of course considering the popularity of Python among individuals working in the field of Data Science and/or Machine Learning, one can expect an even heftier paycheck.

## What Can You Do With Python

- As mentioned earlier, writing Python code is super simple. It's as easy as writing simple one-liners in English as showcased in a video -- [Complexity of Hello World & What Comes After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRhLRvOZEXA&t=367s) for writing the `Hello world!` code in various programming languages. Hence, due to the simple syntax & decreased development time requirements, its often used for system programming. The versatile built-in [OS module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) abstracts a ton of low-level Operating System work with just the call of a simple function. Thus without a doubt, Python is extensibly used to do anything from manipulating system paths, to downloading files over Internet into distinct directories and/or automatically setting up a development environments by manipulating [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/). The sky is the limit in what's possible with the OS module.

- Python isn't really the most favoured language to develop GUI applications but it does have a decent support of the community to develop GUI applications using [Tkinter (_pronounced as "tee-keentar"_)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) which is part of the Standard Library as well! It's perfect for beginners to get into programming as Python being an interpreted language enables the user to see his/her creations right away without compiling or creating binaries. Beside Tkinter, other production capable frameworks like [PyQT5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) are used extensibly by enterprises to desktop applications.

- Perhaps, building desktop applications or simple scripting isn't your thing & you want to learn a skill with a wider employment prospect like web development. Luckily this is where Python shines the most for its general purposeness. Its frequently used to power the backend systems of popular websites like Pinterest, Quora, etc. You can build [RESTful APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) using web frameworks like [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). Unsurprisingly, Flask & Django are also perhaps two of the most popular frameworks to build web apps with beside the likes of Javascript frameworks like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

- Python is also often used as a glue language in certain instances for embedded technologies. Due to the decreased development time, prototypes are built using Python which are then ported to C/C++ for the increased execution speed. Also note it, C libraries can be written using [Cython](https://cython.org/) wherein it can be tested & launched onsite without the need for recompliling.

- Boasting Python's huge Standard Library would be a disappointment if it didn't come with built-in support for Database manipulations. Thus, it supports database manipulation using the [SQLite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) interface. It performs on-file manipulations using the SQL database engine which is perfect for quick prototyping & testing. Beside the on-file SQL system, on the non-SQL side, Python's standard [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module provides a simple object persistence system, enabling entire Python objects to be written into file & file-like objects. Hence, it's widely used in the field of Machine Learning(ML) for saving entire models onto a persistent file-system.

- A major reason for Python's rise in popularity is due to the advancements made in the field of ML & AI. As of writing this book, it's literally considered the de facto go-to programming language for those interested in ML. Coupled with execellent ML frameworks & libraries like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)/[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) & [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), the ML community is yet to embrace any other language whole-heartedly.

- Python has almost completely replaced older popular languages like Fortran/C++ for numerical programming. Its scientific computing library, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a high-performance numeric programming library for Python. Due to its performance speed, Numpy is used extensibly from Astronomy to complex Mathematical Analytics. So if you're a researcher at CERN or you might as well work as a Quant, then you should definitely check it out.

- "_Python IS an general-purpose language_" is a statement you'll hear from literally every Pythonista (A developer who codes in Python)! But nowhere else is it more apparent then generic use cases like Data Mining, Robotics, Automation & similar work.

## Why Use Python

There're probably way more reasons for someone to learn Python than what I can tell about briefly in context to this book. Python is such a versatile language, its used literally in every other field out there which you can think of. To be honest, I could write a small booklet just stating reasons to choose Python over any other languages as your first programming language. Regardless, I chose to list out a few aspects about the Python programming language which beginners who has no prior coding skills should consider.

- Python is a *multi-paradigm* programming language & what does it mean for you as beginner with no prior coding knowledge? You'll get a taste of some of the most popular paradigms of writing code in today's world.You see, as a Python developer, you free to write code in either [*Functional*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) or in [*Object-Oriented*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) styles, albeit each way of writing has it's own merits & demerits which will discussed briefly later in the book. But the point is, learning Python gives you a fair bit of an idea of the most popular coding paradigms out. So in case if you want to learn an Object-Oriented programming language like C++, then migrating to it will be a breeze for you after learning Python.

- Python is a free, open-source project created by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) for the Open-Source Community. This basically means, help is just a Google-search away. The nature of the Open-Source Community is such where everyone is providing a hand to each other for progressing further. So if you're stuck with a question, chances are someone else must've faced the same predicament & asked a question on various communities like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Hence, when in doubt, all you got to do is just perform a Google search with your doubt.

- Apart from being used in many fields of applications, Python is available not just on major platforms like MacOS, Linuxor Windows. If you own an iPhone, check the App Store & you'll probably find an app to practice writing Python code! You don't even have to own a laptop or a desktop to learn Python, if that's not cool enough, I'm not sure what is. Or if you could even use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/), in case you don't want to commit too much before getting a gist of what Python is like.

- As mentioned in a previous point, Python's community is *huge* but diverse as well which is why you might come across many third-party libraries specifically created for specific jobs! For example, do you want to control a robot using a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), then there's a library for it [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/), making your life so much more easier. That was just one example, so as you can already figure out by now, Python can be used not just to create complex Neural Networks but it's extensibly used elsewhere too. The sky is truly the limit to what field Python can be used in. And considering how the community is only increasing over each day, these third party libraries will only get better gradually.

- Python's syntax is natural language-like, it reads like normal English language & you might often hear experts saying, "it doesn't appear Pythonic". What they mean by it, is basically a line of code which could be made more simple to read. Further inside the book, you'll read about List Comprehensions & it'll all make sense why Python's syntax is considered almost natural-language like.

## Python vs Arbitrary Language: Which Is Better

For a beginner with no prior coding knowledge it's fair to wonder which language would be easier to grasp quickly. Most beginners also tend to think, knowing an X number of languages naturally make you a better programmer. If that's what you've been thinking all this while I apologize for bursting your bubble.

You see programming is like driving a car, once learnt, it's hard to forget how to drive one. But if you had to drive a Tesla tomorrow while all your life you've been driving a mini-van, chances are you'll find it awkward initially. In a couple of hours you'll probably be cruising around top-speed limit on the highway. Programming is similar. Since almost all programming languages are somewhat similar at its core. The only major thing making programming languages different from each other are the syntax & paradigms they've to offer. Hence, Python being a multi-paradigm programming language is popular among beginners to learn as their first.

Regardless as beginner choosing a language is obviously difficult which is why I often help them choose one for themselves. I ask them, why do they want to learn to code? Is it because they want to build a website? Or they want to get into the field of Machine Learning? Or perhaps, they just want to learn to code, in general & figure out if programming is something they might be interested in. All of these questions are valid but subjective from one individual to another.

While someone might want to build a web-app to start a business with or the other person might be interested in landing a job as a ML expert. And guess what, Python is actually the perfect language to do both. Infact, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)/[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) are some of the most popular frameworks for web development & Machine Learning respectively. Now if you're already familiar with other programming languages you might be aware of what a framework is already. But for the uninitiated, a framework is basically an objective piece of software application wherein certain design & application aspects are abstracted away. Hence, due to the abstraction, it becomes easier for the developer to, say build a [Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) in just a couple of lines.

Thus, to sum up this section of the chapter, I wouldn't go much into differentiating Python with other arbitrary languages. But I suggest you ask yourself a question, "*Why do I want to learn Python?*". Whatever be your response to the question, therer'e good chances you could accomplish it using simple, plain-old Python. If not then, there has to be a third-party application to help you with your project.

## How To Run Python Programmes

- The simplest way to run Python code is through the interactive command line or commonly known as CLI. Although most Unix-based systems come with Python preinstalled, Windows user has to install by downloading the installer from the official Python website. Thereafter, just typing `python` in the Terminal or Command Prompt for Debin/Mac users & Windows users respectively.

- The interactive pompt is great for quick testing small scripts but a drawback is persistent execution of the lines of code. This makes it extremely difficult to write code & permanently store them for later use. Hence, Python scripts are written in files with the `.py` extension which can then be executed through the Terminal by calling the `python <filename.py>` command.

- In certain use cases like executing a Python script remotely on a server, its convenient to give the file executable privileges in an Unix-like environment. Fortunately, doing so is as easy as typing the `#!/usr/local/bin/python` shebang line at the top of the file & making it a executable using `chmod`.

- If it's not obvious by now, Python scripts are saved using the `.py` file extension. So basically every other Python module is a script with the `.py` file extension. So in a few later sections of the book, whenever an `import` statement is used assume a Python script is being imported from somewhere.

- Using an Editor -- Typing a line of code on the interactive prompt each time a need arises can be exhaustive, inefficient & not so developer-friendly. Hence, its recommended to use some kind of Text Editors or Interactive Development Environemt(IDE) to write your code. Sublime Text, Atom & my personal favorite, Visual Studio Code are some of the popular Text Editors created specifically for coding & development.
