# The `pass` Statement

The `pass` statement does nothing other than being a placeholder to fill up the syntactic requirements of a specific code block. The syntax is also quite trivial which looks like:

_**Example:**_
```Python

if n%2 == 0:    #Checks of even numbers
    pass
else:
    count += 1  #Counts the odd numbers
```
