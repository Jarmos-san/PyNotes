State Change. Is it true that all programs simply establish a state?

It can argued that a controller for a device (like a toaster or a cruise control) simply
maintains a steady state. The notion of state change as a program moves toward completion 
doesn’t apply because the software is always on. Is this the case, or does the software 
controlling a device have internal state changes?

For example, consider a toaster with a thermostat, a “browness” sensor and a single heating
element. What are the inputs? What are the outputs? Are there internal states while the 
toaster is making toast?
