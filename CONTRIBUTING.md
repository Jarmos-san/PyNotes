# Contributing to PyNotes

:+1: :tada:  First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada: :+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the open-source book PyNotes hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [PyNotes Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/pynotes/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to somraj.mle@gmail.com.

## Do You've a Question To Ask?

It's advisable to **reach out to me directly over email or Twitter for a quick response**. Hence, please avoid opening a new issue with one off questions. Instead drop an email at somraj.mle@gmail.com or leave a tweet [@Jarmosan](https://twitter.com/Jarmosan)

## What Should I Know Before Getting Started?

Teaching oneself to code especially if the individual is from a non-technical background is hard work. It's important to refer to a lot of resources, which otherwise would've been readily provided with if the individual would've had a technical academic background. Thus I decided to "re-write" this book for anyone *willing to learn the very underlying concepts of Python programming*.

Hence, PyNotes is targetted towards those individuals who're knowledgeable in programming with Python or any other language but want a no-bullshit resource to quickly grasp the most important concepts. Coding examples have been intentionally left out for enabling the author to quick skim through the concepts. Accordingly, the individual can refer back to the book at another point of time.
