# Contributing to PyNotes

:+1: :tada:  First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada: :+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the open-source version of the book PyNotes hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [PyNotes Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/pynotes/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to somraj.mle@gmail.com.

## Do You've a Question To Ask?

It's advisable to **reach out to me directly over email or Twitter for a quick response**. Hence, please avoid opening a new issue with one off questions. Instead drop an email at somraj.mle@gmail.com or leave a tweet [@Jarmosan](https://twitter.com/Jarmosan)

## What Should I Know Before Getting Started?

Teaching oneself to code especially if you're from a non-technical background is hard work. It's important to refer to a lot of resources, which otherwise would've been readily provided with if the individual would've had a technical academic background. Thus I decided to "re-write" this book for anyone *willing to learn the very underlying concepts of Python programming*.

Hence, PyNotes is targetted towards those individuals who're knowledgeable in programming with Python or any other language but want a no-bullshit resource to quickly grasp the most important concepts. Coding homeworks/lessons have been intentionally left out for enabling the author to quick skim through the concepts. Accordingly, the individual can refer back to the book at another point of time.

## How Can I Contribute?

An open-source book isn't so common on the platform, hence it can be a bit daunting for some individuals to contribute to the project. But in my honest opinion, nothing can be more easier than contributing to an open-source book, thats targetted towards learning a programming language. Hence, crudely I picked some contexts where you might want to contribute to & listed them as follows:

- *Editing*: A book without a follow-up from the perspective of a reader is like an uncut diamond. Useful in certain cases but not shiny enough. Hence, if you're an editor by profession or maybe you've already published a book or two & acquainted with the process of writing one, your expertise can prove very useful to the project.
- *Simpler Explanations*: The explanations provided in the book isn't just from my perspective of understanding the Python programming language but I've curated various other resources from places like StackoverFlow, Reddit, blog posts, etc. More often than not, the explanations aren't always straightforward. Also considering the fact that each individual has different grasping capabilities, these concepts in the book might've an alternative simpler explanation. If you happen to come across one, go ahead & make a PR.
- *Designing*: A book's design is as much important as the content it serves. A good catchy design can help make it stand out from the rest of the crowd, hence, if you're a designer by profession. get in touch?
- *Better Code Examples*: The best way to understand code is through analogy & examples but alas not every examples are easy grasp. Considering how hard it is to read someone else's code, a beginner struggling to understand a code example shouldn't seen as something surprising. Thus any contributions for easy-to-understand code examples are extemely welcome.

Finally, you should be aware of these aforementioned guide as just mere ideas & not strict rules to abide by. So please feel free to contribute to the project in whichever way you're comfortable or you could even get in touch for further discussions.

## Additional Notes

If you've contributed something however small may it be, you should be compensated accordingly. Hence, whenever you make a pull request, please add yourself as a contributor to the project using the following command in PR `@all-contributors please add <username> for <contributions>`. If you wait for a min or two, your name & avatar should show up under the [Contributors](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/pynotes/blob/master/README.md#contributors-) section of the README file.
