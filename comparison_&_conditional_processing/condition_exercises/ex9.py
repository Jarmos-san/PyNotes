Partial Evaluation. This partial evaluation of the and and or operators appears to violate the
evaluate-apply principle espoused inThe Evaluate-Apply Cycle. Instead of evaluating all parameters,
these operators seem to evaluate only the left-hand parameter before they are applied. Is this 
special case a problem? Can these operators be removed from the language, and replaced with the 
simple if-statement? What are the consequences of removing the short-circuit logic operators
