# Assignment

- _**Assignment**_ statements are used prominently for the purpose of preserving objects created by an expression.
- There're three types of assignment:
    + Basic assignment, _**syntax:**_ `variable = expression`.
    + Augmented assignment, _**syntax:**_ `variable += expression`.
    + Multiple assignment which can assign multiple variables at a time considering both sides has equal number of elements. _**Example:**_ `x1, x2 = 2,3`
